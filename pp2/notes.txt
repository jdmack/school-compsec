Do a loop of malloc calls and print the address you've given on a regular linux box
Look at the addresses


cmdb.c will indicate ways to handle the data better if the cmdb app is slow at processing the data being sent

5 minute connection timeout to key server


short jump: EB (then a value between 00 and 7f)
    - /xeb/x01

bug in reivew that will let you duplicate data you send

EXTRA CREDIT
key insight for extra credit, what is ASLR? when cmdb is loaded into memory with ASLR, not everything is randomized. FIgure out what is not randomized and figure out how to use it.

Idea:
return to libc attack
system: 0xb7e60430
set return address to system
try doing it with the address for environment variable SHELL and see if it works
